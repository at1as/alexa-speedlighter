# Speedlighter

Alexa skill for reading entries from my Father's [Photography Blog](http://www.speedlighter.ca/).

Parses [RSS feed](http://www.speedlighter.ca/feed/) for posts in the `Audible` category and reads them out.


### Usage

Pretty straight-forward, just ask Alexa something like:

```
Alexa ask SpeedLighter for the latest post
```

```
Alexa ask SpeedLighter what's new
```
